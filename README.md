# Zookeepr

This program demonstrates the creation of a web server using the Express.js framework, integrated with a front-end application called Zookeeper. The application's data is hosted on a build server, allowing anyone to access it from anywhere without downloading it.

## Built With

- Node.js: The platform used for server-side and networking applications. It's built on Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient.
- JavaScript: A programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is the core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS.
- Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Inquirer: A command-line interface (CLI) that simplifies the process of asking end-users questions, parsing input, validating answers, and managing hierarchical prompts.
